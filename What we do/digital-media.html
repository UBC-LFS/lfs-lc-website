<h3>The Learning Centre offers support for all manner of digital media, be it video and audio production, photography and graphic
    design, or social media and web services. While we are able to provide full production, we often use a hybrid approach
    wherein our digital media experts coach users, providing just-in-time training and stepping in when needed.</h3>
<h2>Support for every step of the production process</h2>
<p>While we are strong advocates of the do-it-yourself (DIY) ethos, the Learning Centre’s experience and resources can ensure
    your project shines. We can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>identify your objectives and target audience</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>advise on best practices</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>determine project scope and timeline</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>find the appropriate post-production software</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>lend you quality equipment</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>provide computers in our Media Lab for you to work on</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>help with production</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Who can use this service?</h2>
<p>Digital media services are open to anyone in the faculty, but the level of support is on a case-by-case basis. We try and
    find a solution that’s tailor-made for each project. Our media equipment and our MediaLab is available to faculty, staff
    and grad students. Undergrads may use the lab for specific projects when sponsored by a faculty member.</p>
